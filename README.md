This library can be used to formulate mathematical expressions and evaluate them. The library can handle abitrary types, and it supports working with arrays/vectors in an elementwise maner (similar to MATLAB). This makes working with array data, like time series, very fast.

The library is extendable, custom types can be handled and new functions and constants can be crated easily.

## Example

The library comes with an example in form of a simple calculator. It can work with equations, store results in variables and call a few functions. Results can be plotted like with a graphical calculator.

You can find this example in the "SimpleCalculator" directory.
